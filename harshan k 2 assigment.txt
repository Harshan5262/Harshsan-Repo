        <h3><br>Dear pavithra,</h3>
        <h3><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How have you been ? I hope you are doing good. What about your family? I hope they are also doing great! Well I'm writing this letter to ask you why you are not coming to college for the last four days?  </h3>
        <h3>Is everything stable? What's the matter? You aer not in the college for the last 4 days. I hope you don't have any illness. The class teacher was asking about you. As youo know there was a practical yesterday and you missed that too. </h3>
        <h3>However, the teacher has told that us that he will explain that practical once more. He has scheduled it for Monday. I hope till then you will come. And if you are not well then please inform me about your health. I'm waiting for your reply.</h3>
        <h3><br>Kind Regard's</h3>
